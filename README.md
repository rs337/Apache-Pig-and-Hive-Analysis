# Apache-Pig-and-Hive-Analysis
This is from Assignment 1 of CA4022 using Apache Pig and Hive on a starbucks dataset

The rough outline of the assignment was to:
1. Choose a dataset - I looked at the Starbucks menu for food and drinks.
2. Complete data cleaning in Pig.
3. Complete 2 simple queries in Hive.
4. Repeat the same queries in Pig.
5. Do an additional 3 complex queries

Within this repository I have included everyhting I have used for the Assignment in folders including:
- [starbucks_raw](https://github.com/rs337/Apache-Pig-and-Hive-Analysis/tree/main/starbucks_raw) - Which contains all of the raw data used.
- [starbucks_clean](https://github.com/rs337/Apache-Pig-and-Hive-Analysis/tree/main/starbucks_clean) - Which has all of the outputs from Pig that I used for the queries.
- [cleaningdANDqueries](https://github.com/rs337/Apache-Pig-and-Hive-Analysis/tree/main/cleaningANDqueries) - This contians my cleaning commands and queries that I used.
